- 👋 Hi, I’m @jpve2
- 👀 I’m interested in advanced algorithms for geological/mining/O&G/Hydro/etc... data, which I did for BRGM between 1972 and 1989
- 🌱 I’m currently retired, but still challenged by algorithmics as a brain teaser
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GDM 2D/3D triangulation extension (surface/volume) targeting hidden faces removal for composite display (2D/3D mix)
-  including isocurves, wireframe, flat shading, Gouraud shading
- 📫 How to reach me : requests through my GitHub/GitLab account
